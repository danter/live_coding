# Live coding

Live coding environment (or IDE) for making things like games using javascript.

# Live Coding IDE

The IDE is built using HTML/CSS/JS and can be run by it's own from `live_coding_ide/index.html`, but is normally hosted by the Elixir based web server in this project, for example at <https://live-coding.herokuapp.com>.

If all you want to do this play around with live coding locally you don't need the web server.

# Web server

The Elixir based web server in this project is intended to provide sharing and collaboration features.

# Development

    mix deps.get
    mix test
    mix run --no-halt
    # Then go to http://localhost:4001 or http://localhost:4001?vim=t

## Various ideas for later

- [ ] A slider or some other type of analog input for changing values slowly, the editor has https://ace.c9.io/api/editor.html#Editor.modifyNumber
- [ ] Shared state over the network, e.g. not only shared code but shared state within the game, etc.
